:::::: keypoints
 - Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same lines of the same file.
 - The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each other’s changes blindly, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved.
  - The `.gitignore` file tells Git what files to ignore.
