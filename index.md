> **Git version control using the command line**


The content here is modified from the software carpentry lesson [**Version Control with Git**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html)**.**

This workshop is intended for users with no experience with git. While there are various options for using git the content here uses the command line and GitHub.

There are no pre-requests for the workshop, however any previous knowledge of the command line (bash/shell) will be helpful.

It is designed to be delivered as an interactive workshop and take approx. 1 hour and 30 mins.
